# Locamotiv: An interactive tool for evaluating multi-camera localization systems

## Introduction
**Locamotiv** is an interactive web app that simplifies the evaluation of multi-camera localization systems. Traditionally, evaluating these systems requires access to ground truth data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Rather than relying on quantitative metrics, Locamotiv allowing users to assess the system's performance visually while providing system hyperparameters that can be adjusted in real time. Locamotiv is currently only configured to run on a single prepackaged dataset, but plans to allow users to upload their own data. 
## Setup Instructions
- To be completed once app is more stable and has been packaged

## Roadmap
- ~~Minimum viable product for submission~~
- Fix bugs, improve javascript video and python clustering performance, refactor
- Embed [homography tool](https://github.com/dbloisi/homography-computation/tree/master)
- Package stable version with tools for downloading and processing StreetAware videos
- Configure object detection network and allow for user upload data
